# Automated testing

By default, `report` function, checks automatically the assumptions of the test based on the parameters of the data entered

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(writR) # Load the writR package

set.seed(123)
Diets <- data.frame(
    weight = c(rnorm(n = 100/2, mean = 70, sd = 7)   # Treatment
             , rnorm(n = 100/2, mean = 66, sd = 7) ) # Control
  , diet = gl(n = 2, k = 100/2, labels = c('Treatment', 'Control') ) )
  
result <- report(
  data = Diets,
  variable = weight, # dependent variable
  by = diet, # independent variable
  type = 'auto', # default
  markdown = TRUE # output in Markdown format (for inline text)? otherwise plain text.
)

result
```

## Inline results in APA style

The core function: `report` by default return a list of length five in Markdown format (as seen before) for inline results. An example using same data as before:

> The analysis of the effects of the treatment shows that treatment group had greater weight (`result$desc$Treatment`) than the control group (`result$desc$Control`). Further analyses shows an statistically significant difference between the groups, `result$full`, evaluated through `result$method`.

translates into this:

> The analysis of the effects of the treatment shows that treatment group had greater weight (`r result$desc$Treatment`) than the control group (`r result$desc$Control`). Further analyses shows an statistically significant difference between the groups, *t* <sub>Student</sub> (98) = 2.509, *p* = 0.014, *d* <sub>Cohen's</sub> = 0.51, CI<sub>95%</sub>[0.1, 0.91], evaluated through Student's t-test for independent samples.

It also let you perform centrality and dispersion statistics for inline results by using the `cent_disp()` function. The next example illustrates its usage:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- datasets::ToothGrowth

res <- with(data, tapply(X = len, 
                         INDEX = list(supp, dose),
                         FUN = function(var)
                           cent_disp(x = var,         # These are default values:
                                     type = 'auto',   # # Automated selection based on normality test
                                     k = 2,           # # Number of decimal places
                                     markdown = TRUE))) # # For inline results
res
```

> The effect of vitamin C on tooth growth was explored in Guinea Pigs, were the group using orange juice (OJ) demonstrated similar values (`res['OJ','2']`) than vitamin C (VC) group (`res['VC','2']`) in tooth length (TL) at 2 miligrams/day. However, at doses of 0.5 miligrams/day, the OJ group did show greater TL (`res['OJ','0.5']`) than VC group (`res['VC','0.5']`).

translates into this:

> The effect of vitamin C on tooth growth was explored in Guinea Pigs, were the group using orange juice (OJ) demonstrated similar values (*M* = 26.06, *SD* = 2.66) than vitamin C (VC) group (*M* = 26.14, *SD* = 4.8) in tooth length (TL) at 2 miligrams/day. However, at doses of 0.5 miligrams/day, the OJ group did show greater TL (*M* = 13.23, *SD* = 4.46) than VC group (*M* = 7.98, *SD* = 2.75).

## Paired samples design

For paired designs you need to set `paired = TRUE`, and then, based on the numbers of groups detected after removing missing values, the test will run depending on the parameters stablished.

#### \> 2 groups

When `type = 'auto'` the next assumptions will be checked for \> 2 paired samples:

| Assumption checked | How is tested                                                            | If met                                    | If not                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Normality          | `stats::shapiro.test` for n \< 50 or `nortest::lillie.test` for n \>= 50 | Sphericity check.                         | Friedman rank sum test                                  |
| Sphericity         | `afex::test_sphericity(model)`                                           | One-way repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) | Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt correction is applied |

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
Cancer <- data.frame(
    cells = round(c(rnorm(n = 150/3, mean = 100, sd = 15)   # Basal
           , rnorm(n = 150/3, mean = 98, sd = 10)   # Time-1
           , rnorm(n = 150/3, mean = 98, sd = 5) )) # Time-2
  , period = gl(n = 3, k = 150/3, labels = c('Basal', 'Time-1', 'Time-2') ) )

report(
  data = Cancer
  , variable = cells
  , by = period
  , paired = TRUE
  , pairwise.comp = TRUE # set to TRUE for pairwise comparisons
  , markdown = FALSE
  )
```

However, you can specify your own parameters for the selection of the test:

| Test                                       | Parameters                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| One-way repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA)  | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'p'` + `sphericity = TRUE` |
| rmANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'p'` + `sphericity = 'GG'` |
| rmANOVA with Huynh-Feldt correction        | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'p'` + `sphericity = 'HF'` |
| Heteroscedastic rmANOVA for trimmed means  | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'r'`                       |
| Friedman rank sum test                     | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'np'`                      |

#### 2 groups

Similar as before, if `type = 'auto'` assumptions will be checked for 2 paired samples:

| Assumption checked | How is tested                                                            | If met           | If not                    |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Normality          | `stats::shapiro.test` for n \< 50 or `nortest::lillie.test` for n \>= 50 | Student's t-test | Wilcoxon signed-rank test |

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
CancerTwo <- Cancer[Cancer$period %in% c('Time-1','Time-2'),]
  
report(
  data = CancerTwo
  , variable = cells
  , by = period
  , paired = TRUE
  , markdown = FALSE
  )
```

Same as above, you can specify your own parameters for the selection of the test:

| Test                                               | Parameters                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Student's t-test for paired samples                | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'p'`  |
| Wilcoxon signed-rank test                          | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'np'` |
| Yuen's test on trimmed means for dependent samples | `paired = TRUE` + `type = 'r'`  |

## Independent samples design

For independent samples you need to set `paired = FALSE`, and then, based on the numbers of groups detected, the test will run depending on the parameters stablished.

#### \> 2 groups

When `type = 'auto'` the next assumptions will be checked for \> 2 independent samples:

| Assumption checked       | How is tested                                                            | If met                          | If not               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Normality                | `stats::shapiro.test` for n \< 50 or `nortest::lillie.test` for n \>= 50 | Homogeneity of variances check. | Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA |
| Homogeneity of variances | `car::leveneTest`                                                        | Fisher's ANOVA                  | Welch's ANOVA        |

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
Cancer <- data.frame(
    cells = round(c(rnorm(n = 90/3, mean = 100, sd = 20)   # Control
           , rnorm(n = 90/3, mean = 95, sd = 12)   # Drug A
           , rnorm(n = 90/3, mean = 90, sd = 15) )) # Drug B
  , group = gl(n = 3, k = 90/3, labels = c('Control', 'Drug A', 'Drug B') ) )

report(
  data = Cancer
  , variable = cells
  , by = group
  , paired = FALSE
  , pairwise.comp = TRUE
  , markdown = FALSE
  )
```

However, you can specify your own parameters for the selection of the test:

| Test                                            | Parameters                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Fisher's One-way ANOVA                          | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'p'` + `var.equal = TRUE`  |
| Welch's One-way ANOVA                           | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'p'` + `var.equal = FALSE` |
| Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA                    | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'np'`                      |
| Heteroscedastic one-way ANOVA for trimmed means | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'r'`                       |

#### 2 groups

Just like above, if `type = 'auto'` assumptions will be checked for 2 independent samples:

| Assumption checked       | How is tested                                                            | If met                          | If not                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Normality                | `stats::shapiro.test` for n \< 50 or `nortest::lillie.test` for n \>= 50 | Homogeneity of variances check. | Mann-Whitney *U* test |
| Homogeneity of variances | `car::leveneTest`                                                        | Student's t-test                | Welch's t-test        |

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  data = Cancer[Cancer$group %in% c('Drug A','Drug B'),]
  , variable = cells
  , by = group
  , var.equal = F
  , paired = FALSE
  , markdown = FALSE
  )
```

You can specify your own parameters for the selection of the test as well:

| Test                                     | Parameters                                            |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Student's t-test for independent samples | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'p'` + `var.equal = TRUE`  |
| Welch's t-test for independent samples   | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'p'` + `var.equal = FALSE` |
| Mann–Whitney *U* test                    | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'np'`                      |
| Yuen's test on trimmed means             | `paired = FALSE` + `type = 'r'`                       |

## Mixed effects ANOVA

By using `aov_r` function is possible to get the statistical report of between/within-subject(s) factor(s) for factorial designs using `afex` package under the hood for statistical reporting. Let's see an example

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# set parameters to simulate data with a between and within subject factor
within <- 3
between <- 2
n <- 400

set.seed(123)
Stroop <- data.frame(
  Subject = rep(1:n, within),
  Gender = gl(between, n/between, length = n*within, labels = c('Male','Female')),
  Time = gl(within, n, length = n*within),
  Score = rnorm(n*within, mean = 150, sd = 30))

# Manipulate data to generate interaction between Gender and Time
Stroop <- within(Stroop, {
  Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 1] <- Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 1]*1
  Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 2] <- Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 2]*1.15
  Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 3] <- Score[Gender == 'Male' & Time == 3]*1.3
  Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 1] <- Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 1]*1
  Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 2] <- Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 2]*0.85
  Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 3] <- Score[Gender == 'Female' & Time == 3]*0.7
})


r <- aov_r(
  data = Stroop
, response = Score
, between = Gender
, within = Time
, id = Subject
, es = 'omega' # omega squared as our measure of effect size
, sphericity = 'auto' # check if sphericity is not being violated
)

r
```

For inline results with previous data we would do something like this:

> In order to analyze the effect of gender on subjects' scores in each of the evaluation periods, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with between- and within-subjects factors. From the analyses, we find that gender has a large effect ( `r$es$Gender` ) on scores when adjusting for each of the time periods, `r$stats$Gender`. In a similar way we find a significant interaction between evaluative time and gender ( `r$stats$Gender_Time` ), indicating unequal responses between males and females over time, `r$es$Gender_Time`, however, time alone is not able to explain statistically significantly the variance in scores, `r$full$Time`.

Which will translate into this after evaluation in R Markdown:

> In order to analyze the effect of gender on subjects' scores in each of the evaluation periods, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with between- and within-subjects factors. From the analyses, we find that gender has a large effect ( 𝜔<sup>2</sup> = 0.63, CI<sub>95%</sub>[0.58, 0.67] ) on scores when adjusting for each of the time periods, *F* <sub>Fisher</sub> (1, 398) = 682.91, *p* \< 0.001. In a similar way we find a significant interaction between evaluative time and gender ( *F* <sub>Fisher</sub> (2, 796) = 223.68, *p* \< 0.001 ), indicating unequal responses between males and females over time, 𝜔<sup>2</sup> = 0.27, CI<sub>95%</sub>[0.22, 0.32], however, time alone is not able to explain statistically significantly the variance in scores, *F* <sub>Fisher</sub> (2, 796) = 0.11, *p* = 0.894, 𝜔<sup>2</sup> = 0, CI<sub>95%</sub>[0, 0].

When you have more than 1 factor (between or within subjects) you have to specify them as a character vector: `between = c('factor1', 'factor2' ...)`, and the same for `within = c('factor1', 'factor2' ...)`.

## Testing categorical data

To test purely categorical data, `contingency()` function is your guy. 

### Goodness-of-fit Chi-squared

By only filling the `data`, and `x` argument, the Goodness-of-fit chi-squared test (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>gof</sub>) 

```{r message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- afex::stroop # Using stroop data from `afex` package

res <- contingency(data = data, 
  x = acc)
res
```

And the inline result would look like this:

> In preliminary analyses, we've seen that the proportion from people who pointed accuratedly in the stroop test was significantly higher than those who don't, `res$full`.

translates into:

> In preliminary analyses, we've seen that the proportion from people who pointed accuratedly in the stroop test was significantly higher than those who don't, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>gof</sub> (1) = 190688.91, *p* < 0.001, *V*<sub>Cramer</sub> = 0.91, CI<sub>95%</sub>[0.95, 0.95].

### Pearson's Chi-squared

By providing `x` and `y` arguments on `contingency()` you get Pearson's Chi-squared test.

```{r}
## Using same data as before
res <- contingency(
  data = data,
  x = acc,
  y = condition,
  markdown = FALSE # Return the output in plain text format
)

res # Print the output
```

### Fisher's exact test

Otherwise, you could use Fisher's exact test for count data if you specify `exact = TRUE`.

```{r}
## Using same data as before
contingency(
  data = data,
  x = acc,
  y = condition,
  exact = TRUE, # Set TRUE for Fisher's exact test
  markdown = FALSE # Return the output in plain text format
)
```

### McNemar's Chi-squared Test

If you have a paired design and are using only categorical variables, then McNemar's Chi-squared Test for Count data is your test to go.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
## Presidential Approval Ratings.
## Approval of the President's performance in office in two surveys,
## one month apart, for a random sample of 1600 voting-age Americans.

Performance <- data.frame(
  ID = rep(1:1600, 2),
  `1st Survey` = c(rep("Approve", 944), rep("Disapprove", 656)),
  `2nd Survey` = c(rep("Approve", 794), rep("Disapprove", 150),
                   rep("Approve", 86), rep("Disapprove", 570)), check.names = F)

contingency(
  data = Performance,
  x = `1st Survey`,
  y = `2nd Survey`,
  paired = TRUE, # Set TRUE for McNemar test
  markdown = FALSE # For plain text output
)
```


## Dependencies

The package writR is standing on the shoulders of giants. `writR` depends on the following packages:

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, dev='svg'}
library(deepdep)
plot_dependencies('writR', local = TRUE, depth = 3)
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Indrajeet Patil for being an inspiration for this package, as an extension of `statsExpressions`. Naturally this package is in its first steps, but I hope that future collaborative work can expand the potential of this package.
